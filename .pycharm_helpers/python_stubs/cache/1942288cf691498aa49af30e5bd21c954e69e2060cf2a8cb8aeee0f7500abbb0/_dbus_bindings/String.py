"""
Low-level Python bindings for libdbus. Don't use this module directly -
the public API is provided by the `dbus`, `dbus.service`, `dbus.mainloop`
and `dbus.mainloop.glib` modules, with a lower-level API provided by the
`dbus.lowlevel` module.

    A string represented using Unicode - a subtype of `unicode`.
    
    All strings on D-Bus are required to be valid Unicode; in the "wire
    protocol" they're transported as UTF-8.
    
    By default, when strings are converted from D-Bus to Python, they
    come out as this class. If you prefer to get UTF-8 strings (as instances
    of a subtype of `str`) or you want to avoid the conversion overhead of
    going from UTF-8 to Python's internal Unicode representation, see the
    documentation for `dbus.UTF8String`.
    
    Constructor::
    
        String(value: str or unicode[, variant_level: int]) -> String
    
    variant_level must be non-negative; the default is 0.

        is contained in: if a message's wire format has a variant containing a
        variant containing a string, this is represented in Python by a
        String or UTF8String with variant_level==2.
