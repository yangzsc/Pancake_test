Classes and functions wrapping the apt-pkg library.

The apt_pkg module provides several classes and functions for accessing
the functionality provided by the apt-pkg library. Typical uses might
include reading APT index files and configuration files and installing
or removing packages.

    TagFile(file, [bytes: bool = False])
    
    TagFile() objects provide access to debian control files, which consist
    of multiple RFC822-style sections.
    
    To provide access to those sections, TagFile objects provide an iterator
    which yields TagSection objects for each section.
    
    TagFile objects also provide another API which uses a shared TagSection
    object in the 'section' member. The functions step() and jump() can be
    used to navigate within the file; offset() returns the current
    position.
    
    It is important to not mix the use of both APIs, because this can have
    unwanted effects.
    
    The parameter 'file' refers to an object providing a fileno() method or
    a file descriptor (an integer).
    
    By default, text read from files is treated as strings (binary data in
    Python 2, Unicode strings in Python 3). Use bytes=True to cause all
    header values read from this TagFile to be bytes even in Python 3.
    Header names are always treated as Unicode.

        Jump to the given offset; return True on success. Note that jumping to
        an offset is not very reliable, and the 'section' attribute may point
        to an unexpected section.
