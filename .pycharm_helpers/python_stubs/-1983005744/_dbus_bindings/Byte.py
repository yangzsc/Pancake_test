"""
Low-level Python bindings for libdbus. Don't use this module directly -
the public API is provided by the `dbus`, `dbus.service`, `dbus.mainloop`
and `dbus.mainloop.glib` modules, with a lower-level API provided by the
`dbus.lowlevel` module.

    An unsigned byte: a subtype of int, with range restricted to [0, 255].
    
    A Byte b may be converted to a str of length 1 via str(b) == chr(b).
    
    Most of the time you don't want to use this class - it mainly exists
    for symmetry with the other D-Bus types. See `dbus.ByteArray` for a
    better way to handle arrays of Byte.
    
    Constructor::
    
       dbus.Byte(integer or str of length 1[, variant_level])

        is contained in: if a message's wire format has a variant containing a
        variant containing a byte, this is represented in Python by a
        Byte with variant_level==2.
